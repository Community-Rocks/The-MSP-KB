# Data Handling & Privacy

### **Introduction**

MSPs must treat AI as a data processor with unique risks. This page outlines how AI tools handle client data, the privacy issues that follow, and the technical and contractual controls needed to keep data secure.

***

### Processing, Storage, and Transmission

AI tools transform inputs (tickets, calls, docs) into outputs, creating risks at each stage. Anything sent to AI may be stored or routed outside your region.

* **Guardrails:** Require **encryption**, **audit logs**, and **zero-retention modes** where possible.
* **Terms:** _Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)_, _zero-retention_, _audit logging_.

### Data Residency and Training Risks

Where data lives and how vendors use it are critical. Laws (GDPR, HIPAA, EU AI Act) restrict cross-border data flow. Some vendors train on customer inputs by default.

* **Guardrails:** Insist on **local data zones** and contract language: _“Customer/tenant data is not used for training.”_
* **Terms:** _Data residency_, _Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)_, _no-train mode_, _output memorization_.

### Anonymization, Redaction, and Tenant Isolation

Reduce what AI sees and keep clients separated. Don’t send sensitive details unless required.

* **Guardrails:** Use **redaction/DLP tools** (AWS Comprehend, Google Cloud DLP) and **synthetic data** for testing. Enforce **tenant isolation** and **RBAC** under a _Zero-Trust Architecture_.
* **Terms:** _Anonymization_, _pseudonymisation/tokenization_, _tenant isolation_, _RBAC_, _ZTA_.

### Contracts and DPAs with Vendors

A strong **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** is the main safeguard. Without the right clauses, vendors may store, transfer, or train on client data.

* **Guardrails:** Require **DPAs** with SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance.
* **Terms:** _Processing details_, _security measures_, _training restrictions_, _residency clauses_, _deletion/return_, _exit strategy (data portability)_

### **Bottom Line**

MSPs must enforce residency, anonymization, isolation, and contractual controls to adopt AI securely while maintaining compliance and client trust.
