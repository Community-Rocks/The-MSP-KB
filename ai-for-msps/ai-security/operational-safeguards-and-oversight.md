# Operational Safeguards & Oversight

### **Introduction**

AI tools should always be deployed with human oversight, safe testing environments, and strong monitoring. By treating AI as a controlled automation layer rather than a black box, MSPs can safely gain value while minimizing risk.

***

### Human-in-the-Loop Enforcement

AI is fallible. Without human review, errors or unsafe outputs can slip into production.

* **Guardrails:** Require staff to review AI outputs (ticket notes, scripts, configs) before applying changes. Treat AI as a _copilot_, never the lead.
* **Key terms:** _human-in-the-loop (HITL)_, _augmentation vs automation_.

### Sandbox Testing of AI Outputs

AI-generated scripts, configs, or automation can misfire if deployed directly.

* **Guardrails:** Enforce **sandbox environments** for testing, followed by peer review. Apply version control and rollback options.
* **Key terms:** _sandbox testing_, _peer review_, _rollback_.

### Incident Response for AI Misfires

AI failures can cause service outages or data exposure if not contained quickly.

* **Guardrails:** Update IR plans to cover AI-specific risks (hallucinated outputs, unauthorized integrations). Include alerting, containment, and rollback steps.
* **Key terms:** _incident response (IR)_, _containment_, _alerting_.

### Logging and Audit Trails

Without visibility into AI actions, errors or abuses go undetected.

* **Guardrails:** Enable audit logging for all AI interactions. Record prompts, outputs, and system actions. Route alerts to SOC/NOC as appropriate.
* **Key terms:** _audit logging_, _non-human identity monitoring_, _traceability_.

***

### AI-Native Security Layers

Traditional controls donâ€™t fully cover AI. Extra layers are needed to prevent misuse or data leaks.

* **Guardrails:** Deploy **prompt filtering**, **DLP scanning**, and usage monitoring. Enforce token limits to manage cost and prevent over-consumption.
* **Key terms:** _prompt injection_, _DLP (data loss prevention)_, _token limits_.
