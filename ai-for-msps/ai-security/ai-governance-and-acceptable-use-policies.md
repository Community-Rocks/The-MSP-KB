# AI Governance & Acceptable Use Policies

### **Introduction**

MSPs need clear governance for how AI is deployed internally and with clients. Policies define whatâ€™s acceptable, prevent misuse, and keep risk ownership clear. This page outlines how to write, enforce, and monitor AI use policies.

### Internal and Client-Facing Policies

Without documented policies, staff or clients may adopt AI tools unsafely, leading to shadow IT and unmanaged risk.

* **Guardrails:** Create separate internal (staff) and client-facing (service) policies. Define roles, responsibilities, and escalation points for AI use.
* **Key terms:** _AI governance_, _acceptable use policy (AUP)_, _risk ownership_.

### Shadow AI and Unauthorized Tools

Users often connect unapproved AI apps (e.g., Teams bots, browser extensions), exposing client data.

* **Guardrails:** Enforce app consent settings, use monitoring tools (Riscosity, Augmentt, Auvik SaaS Management), and treat violations as HR/IT issues.
* **Key terms:** _shadow IT_, _app consent_, _unauthorized integrations_.

### Defining Augmentation vs Automation

Not all AI tasks are equal. Some augment human work, others attempt full automation. Misclassification can create unsafe expectations.

* **Guardrails:** Classify each AI use case. Require human-in-the-loop for automation. State explicitly which functions AI may _suggest_ vs _execute_.
* **Key terms:** _augmentation_, _automation_, _HITL (human-in-the-loop)_.

### Training Staff and Clients

Staff and clients may lack awareness of AI risks, making them vulnerable to misuse or overtrusting outputs.

* **Guardrails:** Deliver regular training on responsible AI use, including safe prompting, data handling, and recognition of AI errors. Use simulations (e.g., phishing with AI-generated lures).
* **Key terms:** _responsible AI_, _prompt hygiene_, _AI-enhanced phishing_.

### Policy Enforcement

Policies are only effective if enforced consistently.

* **Guardrails:** Define consequences for policy violations (HR action, service restriction). Use audits to verify compliance with client AI agreements. Provide clear reporting channels for violations.
* **Key terms:** _policy enforcement_, _compliance audit_, _risk acceptance_.

### **Bottom Line**

Strong AI governance policies give MSPs control over how AI enters their environment. By defining boundaries, enforcing app approvals, training users, and auditing compliance, MSPs can reduce shadow IT and align AI adoption with security standards.
