# Where It Shows Up

AI features appear across PSA, RMM, and specialized tools serving MSPs. This guide identifies specific offerings, costs, and capabilities to help you evaluate what's available today.

### **MSP AI Platform Comparison**

| Platform                 | AI Features                                                                                       | Cost Model                      | ROI Metrics                                           | Data Processing                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Atera**                | Agentic AI Autopilot: device diagnostics, script generation, ticket summarization, alert analysis | Pay-per-technician, $129/month+ | 70% faster troubleshooting                            | SOC 2, ISO 27001 required                        |
| **ConnectWise Sidekick** | Ticket triage, email responses, sentiment tracking, PowerShell scripting                          | $1,042/month savings per tech   | 75% cost reduction, 5 min saved per ticket            | Secure data access, no training on customer data |
| **Autotask PSA**         | Automated categorization, ticket summaries, communication polish                                  | 30-50% faster resolution        | 40% fewer reassignments, 15-30% more tickets per tech | Least privilege access, explicit DPA terms       |
| **Syncro**               | Ticket categorization, summarization, response generation                                         | Pay-per-technician              | Limited scope compared to agentic AI                  | Vet privacy policies carefully                   |

### **Specialized MSP AI Tools**

**Workflow Integration:**

- **Mizo AI:** Connects to HaloPSA, Hudu for intelligent triage and KB search
- **Neo Agent/Cooper Copilot:** Third-party agents for Autotask integration
- **zofiQ:** AI automation layer across multiple PSA/RMM platforms

**Voice/Call Integration:**

- **Nextiva:** Real-time transcription, auto-generated call notes

### **Current ROI Reality**

MSPs report measurable benefits across core metrics:

| Metric Category          | Improvement Range               | Best-in-Class Results      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Resolution Speed**     | 30-60% faster overall           | 60% faster P1 tickets      |
| **Staff Productivity**   | 15-30% more tickets per tech    | Equivalent to adding 2 FTE |
| **Escalation Reduction** | 80-86% fewer escalations        | 90% of L1 noise cleared    |
| **SLA Compliance**       | 20-35% improvement              | 76% first-touch resolution |
| **Alert Management**     | 80-90% false positive reduction | ConnectWise RMM example    |

### **Implementation Categories**

**General AI Assistants:**

- ChatGPT, Claude: Used internally for scripting help
- Microsoft Copilot: Approved due to no-training policy
- Risk: Lack MSP-specific context, generic responses

**PSA-Native Features:**

- Built into existing workflows
- Access to client-specific data and history
- Bi-directional sync with ticket systems

**Shadow AI Detection:**

- **Riscosity:** AI Data Firewall for unauthorized usage detection
- **Augmentt:** SaaS management with AI app discovery
- **Auvik SaaS Management:** Shadow IT detection across client environments
- etc.

### **Evaluation Framework**

Before enabling any AI feature, assess:

**Data Boundaries:**

- [ ] Explicit no-training guarantees in DPA
- [ ] Data residency compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Sub-processor disclosure and audit rights

**Integration Depth:**

- [ ] Native PSA/RMM integration (not just API)
- [ ] Bi-directional data sync capability
- [ ] Custom field mapping support

**Cost Structure:**

- [ ] Transparent per-technician vs usage-based pricing
- [ ] ROI calculation based on time savings
- [ ] Total cost of ownership including training

**Failure Recovery:**

- [ ] Rollback procedures for AI-generated errors
- [ ] Human oversight checkpoints defined
- [ ] Monitoring for drift and accuracy degradation

### **Common Implementation Mistakes**

**Strategic Errors:**

- Expecting AI to solve non-existent processes
- Lack of measurable objectives or success criteria
- Choosing generic tools without MSP context

**Technical Errors:**

- Insufficient data quality before AI implementation
- Poor integration causing duplicate data entry
- Missing human verification workflows

**Key terms**: _agentic AI_, _PSA-native integration_, _shadow AI detection_, _no-train mode_.
