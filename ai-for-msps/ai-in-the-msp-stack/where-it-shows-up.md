# Where It Shows Up

### Introduction

AI features appear across PSA, RMM, and specialized tools serving MSPs. This guide identifies specific offerings, costs, and capabilities to help you evaluate what's available today.

### **Example MSP AI Platform Comparison**

| Platform                 | AI Features                                                                                       | Cost Model                      | ROI Metrics                                           | Data Processing                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Atera**                | Agentic AI Autopilot: device diagnostics, script generation, ticket summarization, alert analysis | Pay-per-technician, $129/month+ | 70% faster troubleshooting                            | SOC 2, ISO 27001 required                        |
| **ConnectWise Sidekick** | Ticket triage, email responses, sentiment tracking, PowerShell scripting                          | $1,042/month savings per tech   | 75% cost reduction, 5 min saved per ticket            | Secure data access, no training on customer data |
| **Autotask PSA**         | Automated categorization, ticket summaries, communication polish                                  | 30-50% faster resolution        | 40% fewer reassignments, 15-30% more tickets per tech | Least privilege access, explicit DPA terms       |
| **Syncro**               | Ticket categorization, summarization, response generation                                         | Pay-per-technician              | Limited scope compared to agentic AI                  | Vet privacy policies carefully                   |

#### Specialized MSP AI Tools

* **Workflow integration**: Mizo AI (HaloPSA, Hudu triage + KB search), zofiQ (AI automation layer), Neo Agent/Cooper Copilot
* **Voice/call integration**: DialPad (transcription → ticket), Nextiva (real-time call notes)
* **Shadow AI detection**: Riscosity, Augmentt, Auvik SaaS Management

#### Why “Agentic AI” Feels Different

Traditional automation executes one script at a time. “Agentic AI” chains multiple probabilistic steps, often using a large language model. Example:

1. Interpret a ticket description.
2. Suggest a diagnostic script.
3. Summarize results into a KB-style note.

Each step is probabilistic. This means agentic AI can save time but also compound errors if no human-in-the-loop exists.

### **Current ROI Reality**

MSPs report measurable benefits across core metrics:

| Metric Category          | Improvement Range               | Best-in-Class Results      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Resolution Speed**     | 30-60% faster overall           | 60% faster P1 tickets      |
| **Staff Productivity**   | 15-30% more tickets per tech    | Equivalent to adding 2 FTE |
| **Escalation Reduction** | 80-86% fewer escalations        | 90% of L1 noise cleared    |
| **SLA Compliance**       | 20-35% improvement              | 76% first-touch resolution |
| **Alert Management**     | 80-90% false positive reduction | ConnectWise RMM example    |

### **Implementation Categories**

**General AI Assistants:**

* ChatGPT, Claude: Used internally for scripting help
* Microsoft Copilot: Approved due to no-training policy
* Risk: Lack MSP-specific context, generic responses

**PSA-Native Features:**

* Built into existing workflows
* Access to client-specific data and history
* Bi-directional sync with ticket systems

**Shadow AI Detection:**

* **Riscosity:** AI Data Firewall for unauthorized usage detection
* **Augmentt:** SaaS management with AI app discovery
* **Auvik SaaS Management:** Shadow IT detection across client environments
* etc.

### Common Implementation Mistakes

#### **Strategic Errors**

**Expecting AI to solve non-existent processes**\
e.g.: deploying AI ticket triage when ticket categories are inconsistent. Garbage in, garbage out.

**Lack of measurable objectives or success criteria**\
e.g.: rolling out AI summaries without tracking average resolution time or escalation rates.

**Choosing generic tools without MSP context**\
e.g.: using ChatGPT directly for ticket notes instead of a PSA-integrated assistant. Results look polished but lack system hooks.

#### **Technical Errors**

**Insufficient data quality before AI implementation**\
e.g.: alert fatigue from noisy monitoring data means AI just replicates the noise faster.

**Poor integration causing duplicate data entry**\
e.g.: AI summary doesn’t sync both ways, forcing manual copy-paste between PSA and RMM.

**Missing human verification workflows**\
e.g.: allowing AI scripts to run without engineer review, leading to “confidently wrong” fixes.

### **Evaluation Framework**

Ask before enabling any AI feature:

* **Data boundaries**: Does the DPA explicitly state “no training” on client data?
* **Integration depth**: Is it native to PSA/RMM or just API glue?
* **Cost model**: Is pricing per-tech, per-usage, or hidden in bundles?
* **Auditability**: Is AI decision-making logged for review?
