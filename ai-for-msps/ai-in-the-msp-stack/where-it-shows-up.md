# Where It Shows Up

AI is already embedded in MSP workflows, usually marketed as “copilot” features. Adoption is concentrated in a few areas:

* **Ticketing/Helpdesk:** Summarizing calls, triaging alerts, detecting duplicates.
* **Documentation/Knowledge:** Searching KBs, drafting runbooks, surfacing related tickets.
* **Security:** EDR/MDR anomaly detection, Microsoft 365 threat analysis, phishing simulation.
* **Engineering:** Script suggestions (PowerShell, Terraform), code boilerplate.

### **Guardrails**

* Validate where AI is already in your stack (PSA, RMM, M365, EDR).
* Check data handling before enabling features (logging, retention, training).

**Key terms**: _copilot_, _EDR_, _MDR_, _RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)_.
