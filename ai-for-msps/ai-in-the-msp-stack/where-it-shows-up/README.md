# Where It Shows Up

### Introduction

AI features are now embedded across PSA, RMM, and specialized tools serving MSPs. Some add measurable value, others are rebranded automation. This section aims to compare what’s available, where it fits, and how to evaluate claims responsibly.&#x20;

### Agentic AI Explained

Agentic AI is marketed as the “next step” beyond automation. In practice, it chains multiple probabilistic decisions together. That makes it more flexible, but also more fragile.

**Key Points**

* Works by chaining LLM-driven tasks (interpret, act, summarize)
* Can save hours in triage and resolution
* Compounds risk if unchecked: one bad step can cascade
* Requires explicit rollback and human sign-off policies

_Example failure_: AI suggests a reboot script for all endpoints based on one vague ticket. Without review, this cascades into widespread disruption.

#### Bottom Line

MSPs now have a broad menu of AI features across PSA, RMM, and specialized tools. Real ROI is possible, but only when features are evaluated against data policies, integration depth, and oversight requirements. Agentic AI should be treated as a junior tech, useful and fast, but prone to confident mistakes without supervision.
