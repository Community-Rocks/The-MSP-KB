# Implementation & ROI

#### Current ROI Reality

MSPs across Reddit and vendor reports note measurable benefits:

* **Resolution Speed:** 30–60% faster overall, up to 60% faster for P1 tickets
* **Productivity:** 15–30% more tickets per tech (≈ 2 FTEs saved)
* **Escalation Reduction:** 80–86% fewer L2 handoffs
* **Alert Management:** 80–90% fewer false positives (example: ConnectWise RMM)

_(Source citations still needed — mix of vendor claims + MSP peer reports.)_

#### Common Implementation Mistakes

Most AI rollout failures come not from the tools, but from how they’re deployed. Avoiding common mistakes prevents wasted spend and broken processes.

**Strategic Errors**

* Expecting AI to solve non-existent processes\
  &#xNAN;_&#x65;.g., deploying AI triage when categories are inconsistent = garbage in, garbage out_
* Lack of measurable objectives or success criteria\
  &#xNAN;_&#x65;.g., rolling out summaries without tracking resolution time or escalation rates_
* Choosing generic tools without MSP context\
  &#xNAN;_&#x65;.g., using ChatGPT for ticket notes instead of a PSA-integrated assistant_

**Technical Errors**

* Insufficient data quality before AI implementation\
  &#xNAN;_&#x65;.g., alert fatigue from noisy monitoring data means AI just replicates noise faster_
* Poor integration causing duplicate data entry\
  &#xNAN;_&#x65;.g., AI summaries don’t sync both ways, forcing manual copy-paste_
* Missing human verification workflows\
  &#xNAN;_&#x65;.g., allowing AI scripts to run without engineer review → confidently wrong fixes_

#### Evaluation Framework

Ask before enabling any AI feature:

* **Data boundaries:** Does the DPA explicitly state _no training_ on client data?
* **Integration depth:** Is it PSA/RMM-native or just API glue?
* **Cost model:** Per-tech, usage-based, or bundled?
* **Auditability:** Is AI decision-making logged for review?

#### Checklist

* [x] Confirm process exists and is consistent
* [x] Define measurable goals
* [x] Verify clean data and integrations
* [x] Keep human-in-the-loop for critical workflows

***

#### Bottom Line

AI won’t fix broken workflows. Success comes from clean processes, clear metrics, and disciplined human verification. The biggest ROI gains come when MSPs treat AI as an augmentation layer, not a replacement for process.
