# AI vs. Automation

Automation executes predefined rules or scripts. AI adapts outputs based on patterns in data, but is probabilistic, not deterministic. Confusing the two leads to false expectations.

* **Automation example:** An RMM script that restarts a failed service on all endpoints.
* **AI example:** A triage assistant that groups tickets by likely root cause based on historical notes.

### **Guardrails**

* Use automation for predictable, repeatable tasks.
* Use AI for judgment calls (summaries, predictions), but always with human review.

**Key terms**: _deterministic automation_, _probabilistic AI_, _RMM_, _ticket triage_.
