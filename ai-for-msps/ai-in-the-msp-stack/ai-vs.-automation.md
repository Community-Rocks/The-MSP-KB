# AI vs. Automation

### Introduction

Automation executes predefined rules or scripts. AI adapts outputs based on patterns in data, but is probabilistic, not deterministic. Understanding this distinction prevents false expectations and helps choose the right tool for each workflow.

### **Technical Difference**

| Characteristic   | Automation                   | AI                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Process**      | Follows predefined rules     | Learns patterns from data           |
| **Output**       | Same result every time       | Varies based on input patterns      |
| **Failure Mode** | Breaks predictably           | "Confidently wrong" answers         |
| **Best For**     | Repetitive, rule-based tasks | Pattern recognition, judgment calls |

### **MSP Workflow Examples**

**Automation in Action:**

* RMM script restarts failed services across 500 endpoints
* PSA creates tickets from monitoring alerts using set rules
* Backup verification runs same checks nightly

**AI in Action:**

* Ticket triage groups similar issues based on description patterns
* Security tools flag unusual login patterns (not specific rules)
* Documentation search suggests KB articles based on ticket content

#### _Why AI Outputs Vary_

Modern AI systems (e.g., GPT, Copilot) use _Transformers_—models built entirely on “attention” rather than fixed sequences. Instead of following a strict rule, they weight different parts of input data to predict what comes next. That’s why two similar tickets can produce slightly different AI triage outputs: the system is making probabilistic judgments, not running a script.

### **Decision Framework**

**Use automation when:**

* Process has clear, consistent rules
* Same input should always produce same output
* Failure impact is predictable and recoverable

**Use AI when:**

* Pattern recognition improves outcomes
* Human judgment would normally be required
* You can verify outputs before acting

### **Common Mistakes**

MSPs in various community spaces regularly state many “AI” features are just automation in disguise.

* **Treating AI like automation:** Expecting consistent outputs leads to over-reliance
* **Treating automation like AI:** Assuming scripts can handle edge cases they weren't designed for

### **Implementation Checklist**

* [ ] Classify each workflow: rule-based or pattern-based?
* [ ] Define success criteria and failure recovery procedures
* [ ] Train staff on when to trust outputs vs verify manually
* [ ] Set up monitoring for both false positives and missed cases

**Key terms**: _deterministic automation_, _probabilistic AI_, _pattern recognition_, _human-in-the-loop_.
