  it differs from automation, and how to assess claims responsibly.

# AI in the MSP Stack

### **Introduction**

AI features are appearing across MSP tools, but marketing often exaggerates or blurs what they can really do. This section provides a framework to:

- Separate vendor claims from actual capability.
- Understand where AI fits into MSP operations today.
- Recognize where human oversight remains essential.
- Evaluate new AI claims with a consistent model.

### **Why Accuracy Matters**

MSPs sit at the intersection of finance, security, and client trust. Misunderstanding AI—by overselling to clients or overbuying from vendors—creates risks such as:

- Spending on features with little or no ROI.
- Gaining false confidence in security or monitoring.
- Automating workflows based on weak or noisy signals.
- Making promises to clients that AI can’t deliver.

### **AI in MSP Work: What It Is (and Isn’t)**

In this guide, AI is treated as an **augmentation layer**, not a replacement. It can:

- Automate repetitive triage and categorization.
- Spot patterns humans miss (e.g., predictive failures, anomalies).
- Summarize and surface knowledge efficiently.
- Assist decision-making while leaving final calls to staff.

It is **not**:

- A system for full autonomy over client environments.
- A “magic fix” that eliminates human review.
- A catch-all label for any form of automation.

### **Audience**

This section is for MSP operators and decision-makers who:

- Need to evaluate AI features in existing tools.
- Want clarity on where AI helps and where it falls short.
- Must explain AI’s role and limits to clients and colleagues.

### How This Section Works

The introduction leads into four short modules:

1. [**AI vs. Automation**](ai-vs.-automation.md) – clarifies the difference, with examples.
2. [**Where It Shows Up**](where-it-shows-up.md) – identifies where AI is embedded today.
3. [**What It Can’t Do Yet**](what-it-cant-do-yet.md) – explains current blind spots and risks.
4. [**Where We’re Going**](where-were-going.md) – a grounded look at what may come next.

Each module builds on the previous. Read in sequence for a clear progression.
