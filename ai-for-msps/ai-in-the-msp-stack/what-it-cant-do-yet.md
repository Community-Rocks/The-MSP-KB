# What It Cant Do Yet

AI is useful, but has hard limits that matter in MSP work:

* **Accuracy gaps:** Models are “confidently wrong” and hallucinate.
* **Context limits:** Without your KB/tickets wired in, answers are generic.
* **Skill erosion risk:** Over-reliance weakens technician troubleshooting.
* **Security gaps:** Consumer AI lacks enterprise-grade audit, logging, and data boundaries.

### **Guardrails**

* Always test outputs in a sandbox.
* Require human-in-the-loop for changes.
* Train staff on when _not_ to use AI.

**Key terms**: _hallucination_, _context grounding_, _sandbox testing_, _HITL_.
