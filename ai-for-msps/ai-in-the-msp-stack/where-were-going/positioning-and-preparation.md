# Positioning & Preparation

### Introduction

MSPs can't win on AI by being “first.” The opportunity is to be the **trusted partner who makes AI safe**: governed, explainable, and client-ready. SMBs will lean on their MSP not for AI hype, but for assurance that new tools won’t create compliance, liability, or trust problems.

***

### **Strategic Positioning**

**MSP Opportunity:** Position as the "safe AI adoption partner" for SMBs by:

* Providing governance expertise clients lack internally
* Managing AI vendor relationships and compliance
* Offering hybrid human+AI service delivery models
* Building AI literacy among client staff

***

### **Preparation Framework**

**Policy:**

* [ ] Draft AI Acceptable Use Policy
* [ ] Create client AI disclosure template
* [ ] Document shadow AI detection

**Vendor:**

* [ ] Audit all AI features in stack
* [ ] Review DPAs for training opt-outs
* [ ] Negotiate liability + residency terms

**Staff:**

* [ ] Train on **output verification** (not just prompts)
* [ ] Add AI steps to incident response
* [ ] Run tabletop exercises for AI misfires

**Ongoing:**

* [ ] Track false positives and misses
* [ ] Log AI-assisted actions for audit
* [ ] Maintain manual fallback for critical workflows

***

#### Bottom Line

MSPs win client trust not by selling AI as revolutionary, but by proving **it won’t outpace accountability.** Strategic positioning is simple: govern it, explain it, and keep people in the loop. The MSP that makes AI safe is the MSP that keeps the client.
