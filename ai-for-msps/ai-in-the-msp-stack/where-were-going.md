# Where We're Going

MSPs should expect more embedded AI across tools, but near-term reality is incremental improvement, not autonomy. Likely developments include:

* **Deeper copilots:** Tighter PSA/RMM integrations for triage, scripting, and KB recall.
* **AI-native security:** Broader use of anomaly detection, SOC alert enrichment, and response playbooks.
* **Cost controls:** Token-based usage models, metered copilots, and AI-specific licensing.
* **Governance layers:** Client demand for policy enforcement, audit logs, and risk ownership clarity.

### **Guardrails**

* Evaluate AI as you would any SaaS: data handling, residency, DPA review.
* Focus on augmenting staff, not replacing them.
* Track cost impact vs. ROI as AI features expand.

**Key terms**: _copilot evolution_, _AI-native security_, _usage metering_, _governance frameworks_.
